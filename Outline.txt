This document is a basic outline of the product description for The Lighthouse.
It will be used in the creation of the Conceptual and Logical models, as well as to
work out any kinks still present in the data-organization side of the product.

Referred to in this document as "The Lighthouse", FindTheLighthouse is a web-based
platform for students at colleges (currently Rochester Institute of Technology, but
built for expansion to any university campus in the future) who are having trouble
finding friends on campus or events to go to that are relevant to their interests.

Although the site is primarily unmoderated, Django administrative powers fall on
the creators of the platform (Trevor Seiders and Chris Baudouin for the RIT branch)
to use as necessary. This could include, but is not limited to, removing broken
posts or those deemed inappropriate for the platform, and editing posts to include
new or altered information. No implementation of any special User account exists
at this time other than the Django Admin standard user.

The Lighthouse is broken into two primary functionalities: connecting Users to other
Users, and connecting Users to Events.

A User is identified by their email address used to register for the site. Additional
information stored includes the first and last names of the User, a username for display
on the public side of the site, and a collection of "tagged" interests.

An Event is identified by a unique id created at the time of event listing (creation).
Events have a title (name), a description, a start time, an end time, and a list of
featured "tags", keywords that will link to the Event when searched. An Event also has
one or more hosts, indicated by a relation with a User.

Tags are used for indexing Users and Events that share those same tags. Current model
dictates that Users input their own interests when creating or editing their profile,
leading to the potential issue of multiple Users logging the same interest with slightly
different inputs. This is potentially solvable with a display of common or recent tags,
so that a User can see examples, or with an autofill feature so that a User can see if
their tag already exists in the database.

Connecting a User to a User is simple: when on the "Connect with People (Working Title)"
page, the Users with the most interests in common with the logged-in User are displayed
below the search bar in groups of ten per 'page'. The logged-in User can click on any of
these profiles to see more information (clicked User's "Profile Page"), or use the search
bar to find Users with specific tagged interests.

Connecting a User to an Event is a similar process. When on the "Meetups (Working Title)"
page, the Events that have similar interests to the User are presented below the search
bar and above the other Events. Other events are sorted in order of start time and limited
to ten per 'page'. By default no event is shown that has a start time after midnight of the
current day. This can be changed by clicking on the "Show All Upcoming Meetups" button.

Lastly, the home page combines these two functionalities. Below a total database search
that can include a username, an Event name, or a tag / series of tags, two buttons bring
the User to either of the aforementioned pages: Find Your People and Find Your Meetups (WT).
Below that is a Happening Now section that lists, in alternating pattern, the five most
recently created User accounts and Events.
